# Multi-GPU-CNN-Training-on-CIFAR-10-with-PyTorch-Fabric
This project implements a multi-GPU image classification pipeline for the CIFAR-10 dataset, optimized for the NCSA Delta supercomputing cluster. It uses PyTorch Lightning Fabric for distributed training and TensorBoard for live metric tracking.
